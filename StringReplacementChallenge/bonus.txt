Jeff and Ooga were walking down the road when Mooga met them at the end of his driveway. "Come join us" said Jeff. And so, Mooga joined Jeff and Ooga and the three of them continued down the road. 

After walking for almost five minutes in complete silence, Mooga finally had had enough. "Why isn't anyone saying anything?"

"Well", said Ooga, "we weren't sure what to say. I mean, we couldn't continue the conversation we were having before you joined us."

"Yeah", said Jeff, "that would spoil the surprise."
